/*
 * [declarator] HtmlEditor::ReceiveFocus( type, whereas, method_body )
 *
 * This declarator will register an implementation of the method "receiveFocus" with the given method_body.
 * The applicability of the method can be restricted by the parameters 'type' and 'whereas'. The method
 * declared by this declarator has the following syntax and semantics:
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Element::receiveFocus( lastFocussed, eventDescription ) ==> [eventAccepted, boolean]
 *
 * Purpose:
 * 		This method will be called, if a view element inside a HTML-Editor receives the focus. The view
 *		object is represented by an Element object (@See DOM). The method will further receive informations
 *		about the circumstances of the focus event and has to return, whether the focus change was accepted
 *		or not. Normally this method will be used, to highlight the element in the editor view and show controls,
 *		which should only be visible on focus.
 *
 * Applicability:
 *		This method is applicable, if the event is related to a model object tagged with <type>. The given
 *		parameters have to be correct according to the specification. The applicability of the requires, that
 *		all clauses of <whereas> are satisfied.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *		lastFocussed		The view node that lost the focus (or null)
 *		eventDescription	A descriptor of the event, which has the following structure:
 *
 *			content					The content object associated with the view node
 *			contextList				The list of content objects marking the semantic context of the content
 *									(see 'parentList' in _view)
 *			destNode				The view node, responsible for the event handling (same as "this")
 *		
 *			selection				The selection object describing the selected content
 *			anchorNode				Node where the user has clicked on
 *			anchorOffset			Text position inside the anchorNode
 *
 *			editor					The editor which is related to the event
 *			event					The DOM Event descriptor	
 *
 * Return value:
 *		TRUE, if the focus is accepted. FALSE otherwise.
 *

 * Purpose:

 *		object is represented by an Element object (@See DOM). The method will further receive informations

 *		or not. Normally this method will be used, to remove focus-related controls from the view and show the
 *		view in an unfocussed manner.
 *
 * Applicability:
 *		This method is applicable, if the unfocussed view object is related to a model object tagged with <type>. 
 *		This relation will be tested using the UUID attribute of the view object. The given
 *		parameters have to be correct according to the specification. The applicability of the requires, that

 *
 * Parameters:
 *		editor		The editor object associated with the node
 *		newFocus	The view node, that should receive the new focus.
